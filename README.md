A 2D platformer game built with Python and Pygame, inspired by the freeCodeCamp.org tutorial:

This personal project was developed in May 2023 during my CFC to strengthen my skills in Python and game development.  
It includes multiple levels, traps, dynamic particles, animations, and a level progression system.

## Features

- Platformer mechanics with single and double jump
- Moving platforms, falling platforms
- Traps: spikes, fire, fans, projectiles
- Timer, checkpoint, collectible fruits (scoring system)
- Melee attack (slash)
- Over 50 unlockable levels
- Custom player and trap animations

## Work in Progress

Planned improvements:

- Full object-oriented refactoring of the game architecture
- Code cleanup: separating collision handling and keyboard input logic
- New features: XP system and player statistics
